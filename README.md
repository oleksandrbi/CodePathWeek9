2. Any issues you encountered:

      I have encountered many different issues and problems durign this week. I first started working on my virual machine, I following all of the rules of the assignment and went milestone by milestone and my honeypot would never start. I have it all set up on the Google Developer Console, but when I place my external IP into my URL, the webpage never loads and just fails. After, obtaining help from the student instructors we have tried again and followed all the steps on my virtual machine again and we obtained the same problem. Following this we had noticed that my virtual machine was behaving very wierdly and this was due to us trying to fix the honeypot. I then tried to run the honeypot directly on my mac, with also failed and resulted in the external IP giving me 504 Bad Getaway Time-out. Please see the included screenshots of all the errors and Google Developer Console.
